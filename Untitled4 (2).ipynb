It can also prevent any attempt to instantiate a subclass that doesn’t override a particular method in the superclass. And finally, using an abstract class, a class can derive identity from another class without any object inheritance.The 'abc' module in Python library provides the infrastructure for defining custom abstract base classes. 'abc' works by marking methods of the base class as abstract. This is done by @absttractmethod decorator"
